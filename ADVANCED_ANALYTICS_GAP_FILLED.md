## 🚀 **INTEGRATION WITH PREDICTION MODEL**

### **📊 ADVANCED ANALYTICS-AWARE PREDICTIONS:**

The advanced analytics system can now be integrated with the prediction model to:

#### **1. EPA-Based Predictions:**
```python
# Get team EPA analytics
home_team_epa = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('BUF')
away_team_epa = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('MIA')

# Factor EPA into prediction
epa_differential = home_team_epa['total_epa'] - away_team_epa['total_epa']
prediction_adjustment = epa_differential * 0.1  # Weight EPA impact
```

#### **2. WPA-Based Predictions:**
```python
# Get team WPA analytics
home_team_wpa = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('BUF')
away_team_wpa = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('MIA')

# Factor WPA into prediction
wpa_differential = home_team_wpa['total_wpa'] - away_team_wpa['total_wpa']
clutch_adjustment = wpa_differential * 0.05  # Weight clutch performance
```

#### **3. Success Rate-Based Predictions:**
```python
# Get team success rate analytics
home_success_rate = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('BUF')['success_rate']
away_success_rate = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('MIA')['success_rate']

# Factor success rate into prediction
success_differential = home_success_rate - away_success_rate
efficiency_adjustment = success_differential * 0.02  # Weight efficiency
```

#### **4. Situational Analytics:**
```python
# Get situational analytics
home_situational = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('BUF')['situational_analytics']
away_situational = analytics_system.get_team_advanced_analytics('MIA')['situational_analytics']

# Factor situational performance into prediction
red_zone_advantage = home_situational.get('red_zone_epa', 0) - away_situational.get('red_zone_epa', 0)
third_down_advantage = home_situational.get('third_down_epa', 0) - away_situational.get('third_down_epa', 0)
```
