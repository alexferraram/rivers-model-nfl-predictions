  - Active roster status
  - Player availability
  - Depth chart positions
  - Starter vs backup identification

### **📊 3. PARTIALLY AVAILABLE DATA WITH SIGNIFICANT GAPS**

#### **🏈 Fumble Recovery Data**
- **Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY AVAILABLE**
- **Available**: `fumble_recovery_1_player_id`, `fumble_recovery_1_player_name`, `fumble_recovery_1_team`
- **Missing**: Direct `fumble_recovery` column
- **Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Can calculate but requires complex logic

#### **🏟️ Field Goal Data**
- **Status**: ⚠️ **PARTIALLY AVAILABLE**
- **Available**: `field_goal_attempt`, `field_goal_result`
- **Missing**: Direct `field_goal` play type column
- **Impact**: **LOW** - Can derive from available data

#### **📈 Penalty Yards Data**
- **Status**: ⚠️ **SEVERELY LIMITED**
- **Available**: Only 460/5527 records (8.3%)
- **Impact**: **MEDIUM** - Most penalty data is missing

#### **🏃‍♂️ Passing/Rushing Yards Data**
- **Status**: ⚠️ **LIMITED AVAILABILITY**
- **Passing Yards**: Only 1372/5527 records (24.8%)
- **Rushing Yards**: Only 1654/5527 records (29.9%)
- **Impact**: **HIGH** - Core offensive metrics are incomplete

## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES WITH CURRENT MODEL**

### **1. INJURY SIMULATION IS COMPLETELY FAKE**
```python
# This is NOT real data - it's just simulation!
self.injury_impacts = {
    'qb_starter_out': 0.70,  # FAKE DATA
    'qb_backup_playing': 0.85,  # FAKE DATA
    'multiple_injuries': 0.90,  # FAKE DATA
}
```

### **2. ROSTER STATUS IS UNKNOWN**
- Cannot determine who is actually playing
- Cannot identify starters vs backups
- Cannot assess depth chart impact

### **3. INCOMPLETE OFFENSIVE STATS**
- Only 24.8% of passing yards data available
- Only 29.9% of rushing yards data available
- Penalty data severely limited (8.3%)

### **4. FAKE MOMENTUM CALCULATIONS**
```python
# This is based on incomplete data!
momentum_stats['recent_yards_trend'] = recent_yards / max(season_yards, 1)
```

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED MODEL REVISION**

### **✅ USE ONLY RELIABLE DATA:**

#### **Core Variables (High Confidence)**
1. **Game Outcomes**: Win/Loss records
2. **Basic Efficiency**: Yards per play, first downs
3. **Turnovers**: Interceptions, fumbles lost
4. **Situational**: Third down conversions, red zone
5. **Advanced Metrics**: EPA, success rate
6. **Schedule Factors**: Home/away, rest days, weather

#### **❌ REMOVE UNRELIABLE DATA:**
1. **Injury Status**: Cannot be determined
2. **Roster Information**: Not available
3. **Individual Player Stats**: Incomplete data
4. **Penalty Analysis**: Severely limited data
5. **Momentum Trends**: Based on incomplete data

### **🔧 SIMPLIFIED MODEL APPROACH:**

```python
# Use only verified available data
reliable_features = [
    'yards_per_play',           # 96.9% available
    'first_downs_per_game',    # 96.9% available  
    'turnovers_per_game',       # 96.9% available
    'third_down_rate',          # 83.6% available
    'redzone_rate',            # 92.7% available
    'epa_per_play',            # 98.8% available
    'home_field_advantage',    # 100% available
    'weather_impact',          # Available in schedule
    'rest_days',               # Can calculate from schedule
]
```

## ⚠️ **CURRENT MODEL ACCURACY CONCERNS**

The current comprehensive model is making predictions based on:
- **Fake injury data** (simulated scenarios)
- **Incomplete offensive statistics** (24-30% data coverage)
- **Unknown roster status** (can't determine who's playing)
- **Simulated momentum trends** (based on incomplete data)

**This significantly reduces the model's reliability and could lead to inaccurate predictions.**

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION**

**Create a simplified model using only verified, complete data sources:**

1. **Remove all injury-based predictions**
2. **Use only high-availability statistics** (>90% data coverage)
3. **Focus on team-level metrics** rather than individual player stats
4. **Emphasize schedule and situational factors** (which are complete)
5. **Use advanced metrics** (EPA, success rate) which have high availability

This will result in a more reliable, data-driven model that doesn't rely on simulated or incomplete information.
