# Deployment Summary - RIVERS Model Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed RIVERS Model Integration
- **File**: `app_2025_week3.py`
- **Issue**: Model was returning `'winner'` but code expected `'predicted_winner'`
- **Fix**: Updated line 228 to use `prediction['winner']` instead of `prediction['predicted_winner']`

### 2. Updated Injury Penalty System
- **File**: `dynamic_injury_system.py`
- **Changes**:
  - QB penalties: Reduced from 5%-15% to 4%-14% range
  - Offensive line penalties: Increased by 50% (now 1.5%-3.75% range)
  - RB penalties: Further reduced by 40% (total 60% reduction from original)

### 3. Improved ESPN Score Scraping
- **File**: `app_2025_week3.py`
- **Changes**: Enhanced `fetch_nfl_scores_from_espn()` function to better parse ESPN's HTML structure
- **Fallback**: Still includes Miami vs Buffalo game manually for Week 3

### 4. Updated Database with New Predictions
- **Database**: `nfl_predictions.db`
- **Action**: Cleared and repopulated Week 3 predictions with new RIVERS model results
- **Results**: 16 games with updated confidence levels and injury reports

### 5. Fixed Statistics and Auto-Update Functionality
- **Files**: `app_2025_week3.py`, `templates/stats_complete.html`
- **Status**: Both functions are working correctly

## Key Prediction Changes

The new RIVERS model predictions show significant changes due to the updated penalty system:

- **Joe Burrow (CIN)**: Now shows -11.50% impact (down from -12.5%)
- **J.J. McCarthy (MIN)**: Now shows -5.00% impact (down from -6.0%)
- **Ryan Kelly (MIN)**: Now shows -2.16% impact (up from -1.44% due to increased OL penalties)

## Deployment Instructions

Since git push is not working due to authentication issues, you can deploy using:

1. **GitHub Web Interface**: Upload the updated `app_2025_week3.py` file
2. **Render Manual Deploy**: Use the manual deploy option in Render dashboard
3. **GitHub Desktop**: If you have it installed, use the GUI to push changes

## Files That Need to be Updated on Render

1. `app_2025_week3.py` (main application file)
2. `dynamic_injury_system.py` (injury penalty system)
3. `nfl_predictions.db` (database with new predictions)

The website should then show the updated predictions with the new penalty system and working auto-update scores functionality.
