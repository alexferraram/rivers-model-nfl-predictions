# üè• DYNAMIC INJURY SYSTEM - COMPLETE REWORK

## ‚úÖ **MAJOR CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. DIRECT WIN PROBABILITY IMPACT**
**‚ùå OLD SYSTEM:** Fixed 5% weight that skewed all predictions
**‚úÖ NEW SYSTEM:** Direct impact on overall score and win probability

### **2. POSITION-SPECIFIC IMPACT SCALING**
**Based on NFL Analytics and Betting Line Impact:**

| Position | Impact Range | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **QB** | **8-20%** | Elite QBs cause massive win probability drops |
| **Skill Positions** | **1-5%** | Elite WR/RB cause 1-5% win probability drops |
| **Offensive Line** | **0.5-2%** | Single OL injury causes minimal impact |
| **Defense** | **0.5-2%** | Only elite defenders cause significant impact |
| **Special Teams** | **0.5%** | Minimal impact on win probability |

## üö´ **INJURY STATUS RULES**

### **COUNT AS INJURED:**
- **OUT:** Definite absence (100% impact)
- **DOUBTFUL:** Likely to miss (80% impact)
- **IR/PUP/NFI:** Season ending (100% impact)

### **COUNT AS HEALTHY:**
- **QUESTIONABLE:** Typically play (0% impact)

### **EXCLUSION RULES:**
- **Long-term injuries (>2 months):** Team already adjusted
- **Season-starting injuries:** Team already adjusted
- **Multiple injuries:** Compound effect considered

## üìä **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Elite QB Injured**
- **Player:** Josh Allen (QB) - OUT
- **PFF Grade:** 90.0 (Elite)
- **Backup Grade:** 60.0 (Poor)
- **Base Impact:** 20% win probability drop
- **Backup Adjustment:** 30% (poor backup)
- **Status Multiplier:** 100% (OUT)
- **Final Impact:** 20% √ó 0.3 √ó 1.0 = **6.0% win probability drop**

### **Example 2: Elite WR Injured**
- **Player:** Stefon Diggs (WR) - DOUBTFUL
- **PFF Grade:** 85.0 (Elite)
- **Backup Grade:** 70.0 (Average)
- **Base Impact:** 5% win probability drop
- **Backup Adjustment:** 40% (average backup)
- **Status Multiplier:** 80% (DOUBTFUL)
- **Final Impact:** 5% √ó 0.4 √ó 0.8 = **1.6% win probability drop**

### **Example 3: Average DE Injured**
- **Player:** Von Miller (DE) - OUT
- **PFF Grade:** 80.0 (Above Average)
- **Backup Grade:** 75.0 (Above Average)
- **Base Impact:** 1% win probability drop
- **Backup Adjustment:** 30% (good backup)
- **Status Multiplier:** 100% (OUT)
- **Final Impact:** 1% √ó 0.3 √ó 1.0 = **0.3% win probability drop**

## ‚öñÔ∏è **WEIGHT REDISTRIBUTION**

### **REMOVED 5% INJURY WEIGHT:**
- **Enhanced EPA:** 24% ‚Üí **26%** (+2%)
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** 24% ‚Üí **26%** (+2%)
- **Enhanced Yards:** 19% ‚Üí **21%** (+2%)
- **Enhanced Turnovers:** 19% ‚Üí **21%** (+2%)
- **PFF Matchups:** 8% ‚Üí **8%** (unchanged)
- **Weather:** 1% ‚Üí **1%** (unchanged)

### **NEW WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION:**
```
Enhanced EPA:          26%
Enhanced Efficiency:   26%
Enhanced Yards:        21%
Enhanced Turnovers:    21%
PFF Matchups:           8%
Weather:                1%
Dynamic Injuries:    Direct Impact
```
