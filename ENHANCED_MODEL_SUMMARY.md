## 🏥 **ENHANCED INJURY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION**

### **1. Fixed Injury Status Logic:**
- **OUT:** Counted as injured (full penalty)
- **DOUBTFUL:** Counted as injured (70% penalty)
- **QUESTIONABLE:** Counted as healthy (0% penalty) ✅ **FIXED**
- **IR:** Traditional penalty (full penalty)

### **2. Dynamic PFF-Based Penalties:**
**Calculation Method:**
1. Get starter's PFF grade
2. Get backup's PFF grade  
3. Calculate grade difference
4. Apply dynamic multiplier based on difference

**Dynamic Multipliers:**
- **Grade Difference > 20:** 1.5x penalty (Elite starter, poor backup)
- **Grade Difference > 10:** 1.2x penalty (Good starter, average backup)
- **Grade Difference > 0:** 1.0x penalty (Starter better than backup)
- **Grade Difference > -10:** 0.8x penalty (Similar quality)
- **Grade Difference < -10:** 0.5x penalty (Backup might be better)

### **3. Position Base Penalties:**
```
QB:  -30.0 points    RB:  -15.0 points    WR:  -15.0 points
TE:  -12.0 points    OT:  -10.0 points    OG:   -8.0 points
C:    -8.0 points    DE:  -10.0 points    DT:   -8.0 points
LB:   -8.0 points    CB:  -10.0 points    S:    -8.0 points
K:    -4.0 points    P:   -3.0 points     LS:   -2.0 points
```

### **4. Backup Quality Assessment:**
- **If 2+ players at position:** Use 2nd best PFF grade
- **If 1 player at position:** Assume backup is 15 points worse
- **If no players found:** Use default backup grades

### **5. Example Calculations:**
- **Elite QB (90 grade) with poor backup (60 grade):**
  - Grade difference: 30 points
  - Multiplier: 1.5x
  - Final penalty: -30.0 × 1.5 = **-45.0 points**

- **Average WR (75 grade) with similar backup (70 grade):**
  - Grade difference: 5 points
  - Multiplier: 1.0x
  - Final penalty: -15.0 × 1.0 = **-15.0 points**

- **DOUBTFUL status adds 0.7x multiplier:**
  - Elite QB DOUBTFUL: -45.0 × 0.7 = **-31.5 points**

## 🔍 **PFF ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM**

### **Integration Method:**
- **Traditional metrics provide the foundation**
- **PFF data provides enhancement factors**
- **Enhancement is added to traditional score**
- **Final score = Traditional + PFF Enhancement**

### **Enhancement Calculation:**
Each component gets 4 PFF enhancement factors:
1. **Player-Grade Enhancement:** Individual player performance vs team average
2. **Contextual Enhancement:** PFF grades account for opponent strength
3. **Position-Specific Enhancement:** Position grades weighted by importance
4. **Clutch Performance Enhancement:** High-leverage situation grades

**Formula:** Enhancement = (Factor1 + Factor2 + Factor3 + Factor4) / 4
**Capped at:** ±5 to ±10 points depending on component

## 🆕 **NEW PFF MATCHUP ANALYSIS (8% weight)**

### **1. Passing Game Sophistication Matchup:**
- Time to Throw, ADOT, Pass Blocking Efficiency
- Receiver Separation, Contested Catch Success, Drop Rate

### **2. Defensive Sophistication Matchup:**
- Run Stop Percentage, Missed Tackles Forced
- Pass Rush Efficiency, Coverage Grades, Blitz Effectiveness

### **3. Scheme Matchup Analysis:**
- Route Tree Analysis, Formation Effectiveness
- Personnel Groupings, Tempo Analysis, Situational Play Calling
