---

## 📊 **1. YARDS FUNDAMENTALS**

### **What is Yards Per Play?**
Yards Per Play is the average yardage gained or allowed per offensive play. It answers: "How efficiently does a team gain yards on offense and prevent yards on defense?"

### **Yards Per Play Definition**
```
Yards Per Play = Total Yards Gained / Total Offensive Plays
```

### **Yards Per Play Thresholds**
- **Elite Offense:** 6.0+ yards per play
- **Above Average:** 5.5-5.9 yards per play
- **Average:** 5.0-5.4 yards per play
- **Below Average:** 4.5-4.9 yards per play
- **Poor:** <4.5 yards per play

### **Why Yards Per Play Matters**
- **Efficiency:** Shows how effectively teams move the ball
- **Field Position:** Better yards per play improves field position
- **Drive Success:** Higher yards per play leads to more scoring drives
- **Predictive Value:** Strong correlation with offensive success and wins

```

### **Yards Per Play Calculation Logic**
```python
def calculate_yards_per_play(team_data):
    # Filter out special teams plays (punts, kicks, etc.)
    offensive_plays = team_data[
        team_data['play_type'].isin(['pass', 'run', 'qb_kneel', 'qb_spike'])
    ]
    
    if offensive_plays.empty:
        return 0.0
    
    # Calculate yards per play
    total_yards = offensive_plays['yards_gained'].sum()
    total_plays = len(offensive_plays)
    
    return total_yards / total_plays if total_plays > 0 else 0.0
```

### **Data Volume & Coverage**

## ⚖️ **3. PROGRESSIVE WEIGHTING SYSTEM**

### **Week-by-Week Weight Distribution**
```python
progressive_weights = {
    1: {'current': 0.88, '2024': 0.10, '2023': 0.02},
    2: {'current': 0.90, '2024': 0.08, '2023': 0.02},
    3: {'current': 0.94, '2024': 0.05, '2023': 0.01},  # Current Week
    4: {'current': 0.96, '2024': 0.04, '2023': 0.00},
    5: {'current': 0.98, '2024': 0.02, '2023': 0.00},
    6: {'current': 1.00, '2024': 0.00, '2023': 0.00},
    # ... continues through week 18
}
```

### **Weighting Rationale for Yards**
- **Current Season Dominance:** 94% weight reflects recent yardage trends
- **2024 Season Context:** 5% weight provides baseline yardage comparison
- **2023 Season Fade:** 1% weight for historical context only
- **Progressive Increase:** Current season weight increases each week
- **Complete Transition:** By Week 6, only current season data used

### **Mathematical Implementation**
```python
def apply_progressive_weights(yards_by_season, week_weights):
    weighted_yards = 0
    total_weight = 0
    
    for season, yards_per_play in yards_by_season.items():
        if season == 2025:
            weight = week_weights['current']
        elif season == 2024:
            weight = week_weights['2024']
        elif season == 2023:
            weight = week_weights['2023']
        
        weighted_yards += yards_per_play * weight
        total_weight += weight
    
    return weighted_yards / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0
```

## 🔢 **4. NORMALIZATION PROCESS**

### **Raw Yards Per Play Range**
- **Typical Range:** 3.0 to 7.0 yards per play
- **Elite Teams:** 6.0+ yards per play
- **Poor Teams:** 4.0- yards per play
- **League Average:** ~5.2 yards per play

### **Normalization Formula**
```python
def normalize_yards_score(raw_yards_per_play):
    # Scale yards per play to 0-100 range
    # 5.0 yards per play = 50 normalized score (league average)
    # 6.0 yards per play = 60 normalized score (above average)
    # 4.0 yards per play = 40 normalized score (below average)
    
    # Linear scaling: (yards_per_play - 3.0) / (7.0 - 3.0) * 100
    normalized_yards = max(0, min(100, ((raw_yards_per_play - 3.0) / 4.0) * 100))
    return normalized_yards
```

### **Normalization Examples**
- **Yards Per Play: 6.5** → **Normalized: 87.5** (excellent yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 6.0** → **Normalized: 75.0** (above average yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 5.5** → **Normalized: 62.5** (good yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 5.0** → **Normalized: 50.0** (average yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 4.5** → **Normalized: 37.5** (below average yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 4.0** → **Normalized: 25.0** (poor yardage)
- **Yards Per Play: 3.5** → **Normalized: 12.5** (very poor yardage)

### **Why Linear Scaling?**
- **Intuitive Interpretation:** Direct relationship between yards and score
- **Natural Range:** 3.0-7.0 yards per play maps well to 0-100 scale
- **Easy Comparison:** Higher yards per play = higher score
- **Statistical Clarity:** No complex transformations needed

```python
def calculate_enhanced_yards_score(team_abbr, pbp_data, week_weights, opponent_team=None):
    # Get team data
    team_data = pbp_data[pbp_data['posteam'] == team_abbr].copy()
    
    if team_data.empty:
        return get_default_yards_result()
    
    # Calculate yards by season
    yards_by_season = calculate_yards_by_season(team_data)
    
    # Apply PFF yards enhancements
    enhanced_yards_by_season = {}
    for season, yards_per_play in yards_by_season.items():
        enhanced_yards = apply_pff_yards_enhancements(
            team_abbr, season, yards_per_play, team_data, opponent_team
        )
        enhanced_yards_by_season[season] = enhanced_yards
    
    # Apply progressive weights
    weighted_yards = apply_progressive_weights(enhanced_yards_by_season, week_weights)
    
    # Calculate situational breakdowns

## 📈 **KEY DIFFERENCES FROM EPA AND EFFICIENCY SCORES**

### **EPA vs Efficiency vs Yards Focus**
- **EPA Score:** Measures value added per play (points impact)
- **Efficiency Score:** Measures success rate per play (execution consistency)
- **Yards Score:** Measures yardage gained per play (field position impact)

### **Complementary Analysis**
- **EPA Score:** "How much value does each play create?"
- **Efficiency Score:** "How often do plays succeed?"
- **Yards Score:** "How much yardage does each play gain?"

### **Combined Power**
Together, these three weighted variables provide:
- **Value Assessment:** EPA Score shows play impact
- **Execution Assessment:** Efficiency Score shows play success
- **Yardage Assessment:** Yards Score shows field position impact
- **Complete Picture:** All three metrics together reveal full offensive/defensive performance

**The Enhanced Yards Score, Enhanced EPA Score, and Enhanced Efficiency Score work in perfect harmony to provide the most comprehensive football analysis possible, measuring the value, consistency, and yardage of every play.**
