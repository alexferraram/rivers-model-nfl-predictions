## 🚀 **INTEGRATION WITH PREDICTION MODEL**

### **📊 PLAYER-AWARE PREDICTIONS:**

The player statistics system can now be integrated with the prediction model to:

#### **1. Individual Player Impact:**
```python
# Get key player statistics
qb_stats = player_system.get_player_passing_stats('J.Allen', 'BUF')
rb_stats = player_system.get_player_rushing_stats('J.Cook', 'BUF')

# Factor into prediction
qb_rating = qb_stats['passer_rating']
rb_yards_per_attempt = rb_stats['yards_per_attempt']
```

#### **2. Team Offensive Strength:**
```python
# Get team player statistics
team_stats = player_system.get_team_player_stats('BUF')

# Calculate team offensive metrics
total_passing_yards = sum(stats['passing']['pass_yards'] for stats in team_stats.values())
total_rushing_yards = sum(stats['rushing']['rush_yards'] for stats in team_stats.values())
```

#### **3. Matchup Analysis:**
```python
# Compare player vs player
home_qb_stats = player_system.get_player_passing_stats('J.Allen', 'BUF')
away_qb_stats = player_system.get_player_passing_stats('T.Tagovailoa', 'MIA')

# Factor QB matchup into prediction
qb_advantage = home_qb_stats['passer_rating'] - away_qb_stats['passer_rating']
```
