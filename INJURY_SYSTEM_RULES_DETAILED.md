# üè• DYNAMIC INJURY SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE RULES SUMMARY

## üéØ **CORE PRINCIPLE**
**Direct Impact on Win Probability:** Instead of using a fixed 5% weight that skews all predictions, injuries now directly impact the overall team score and win probability based on position importance and player quality.

---

## üìä **POSITION-SPECIFIC IMPACT SCALING**

### **1. QUARTERBACK INJURIES (Highest Impact)**
**Impact Range: 8-20% win probability drop**

#### **Base Impact by PFF Grade:**
- **Elite QB (85+ PFF):** 20% win probability drop
- **Above Average QB (75+ PFF):** 15% win probability drop
- **Average QB (65+ PFF):** 10% win probability drop
- **Below Average QB (<65 PFF):** 8% win probability drop

#### **Backup Quality Adjustments:**
- **Good Backup (75+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 70% (30% of original impact)
- **Average Backup (65+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 50% (50% of original impact)
- **Poor Backup (<65 PFF):** Reduces impact by 30% (70% of original impact)
- **Rookie First Start (No PFF Data):** Half penalty (50% reduction)

#### **Example Calculations:**
```
Elite QB (90 PFF) vs Poor Backup (60 PFF):
Base Impact: 20% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.3 = 6.0% win probability drop

Average QB (70 PFF) vs Good Backup (80 PFF):
Base Impact: 10% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.3 = 3.0% win probability drop
```

### **2. SKILL POSITION INJURIES (Moderate Impact)**
**Impact Range: 1-5% win probability drop**
**Positions: WR, RB, TE**

#### **Base Impact by PFF Grade:**
- **Elite Player (85+ PFF):** 5% win probability drop
- **Above Average (75+ PFF):** 3% win probability drop
- **Average Player (65+ PFF):** 2% win probability drop
- **Below Average (<65 PFF):** 1% win probability drop

#### **Backup Quality Adjustments:**
- **Good Backup (75+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 60% (40% of original impact)
- **Average Backup (65+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 40% (60% of original impact)
- **Poor Backup (<65 PFF):** Reduces impact by 20% (80% of original impact)

#### **Example Calculations:**
```
Elite WR (85 PFF) vs Average Backup (70 PFF):
Base Impact: 5% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.6 = 3.0% win probability drop

Average RB (70 PFF) vs Good Backup (80 PFF):
Base Impact: 2% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.4 = 0.8% win probability drop
```

### **3. OFFENSIVE LINE INJURIES (Minimal Impact)**

#### **Base Impact by PFF Grade:**
- **Elite OL (85+ PFF):** 2.0% √ó position multiplier
- **Above Average (75+ PFF):** 1.5% √ó position multiplier
- **Average (65+ PFF):** 1.0% √ó position multiplier
- **Below Average (<65 PFF):** 0.5% √ó position multiplier

#### **Backup Quality Adjustments:**
- **Good Backup (75+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 50%
- **Average Backup (65+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 30%
- **Poor Backup (<65 PFF):** Reduces impact by 10%

#### **Example Calculations:**
```
Elite OT (85 PFF) vs Average Backup (70 PFF):
Base Impact: 2.0% √ó Position Multiplier: 1.0 √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.7 = 1.4% win probability drop

Average C (70 PFF) vs Good Backup (80 PFF):
Base Impact: 1.0% √ó Position Multiplier: 0.8 √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.5 = 0.4% win probability drop
```

### **4. DEFENSIVE INJURIES (Case-by-Case)**
**Impact Range: 0.5-2% win probability drop**
**Positions: DE, DT, LB, CB, S**

#### **Base Impact by PFF Grade:**
- **Elite Defender (85+ PFF):** 2% win probability drop
- **Above Average (75+ PFF):** 1% win probability drop
- **Average/Below Average (<75 PFF):** 0.5% win probability drop

#### **Backup Quality Adjustments:**
- **Good Backup (75+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 70%
- **Average Backup (65+ PFF):** Reduces impact by 50%
- **Poor Backup (<65 PFF):** Reduces impact by 30%

#### **Example Calculations:**
```
Elite DE (85 PFF) vs Average Backup (70 PFF):
Base Impact: 2% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.5 = 1.0% win probability drop

Average CB (70 PFF) vs Good Backup (80 PFF):
Base Impact: 0.5% √ó Backup Adjustment: 0.3 = 0.15% win probability drop
```

---

### **5. SPECIAL TEAMS INJURIES (Minimal Impact)**

#### **Backup Quality Adjustments:**
- **Good Backup:** Reduces impact by 20%
- **Average Backup:** Reduces impact by 20%
- **Poor Backup:** Reduces impact by 20%

## üö´ **INJURY STATUS RULES**

### **COUNT AS INJURED (Apply Penalties):**
- **OUT:** Definite absence - 100% impact multiplier
- **DOUBTFUL:** Likely to miss - 80% impact multiplier
- **IR (Injured Reserve):** Season ending - 100% impact multiplier
- **PUP (Physically Unable to Perform):** 90% impact multiplier
- **NFI (Non-Football Injury):** 90% impact multiplier

### **COUNT AS HEALTHY (No Penalties):**
- **QUESTIONABLE:** Typically play - 0% impact (counted as healthy)
- **PROBABLE:** Likely to play - 0% impact (counted as healthy)

### **Status Multiplier Examples:**
```
Elite QB OUT: 20% √ó 1.0 = 20% win probability drop
Elite QB DOUBTFUL: 20% √ó 0.8 = 16% win probability drop
Elite QB QUESTIONABLE: 20% √ó 0.0 = 0% win probability drop
```

---

## ‚è∞ **EXCLUSION RULES**

### **1. Long-Term Injuries (>2 Months)**
**Rule:** Players injured for more than 2 months should not count against win probability
**Rationale:** Team has already adjusted to the loss of that player
**Implementation:** Check return date vs. current date

### **2. Season-Starting Injuries**
**Rule:** Players injured from the beginning of the season should not count against win projections
**Rationale:** Team has already adjusted to the loss of that player
**Implementation:** Check injury date vs. season start date

### **3. Multiple Injury Compound Effects**
**Rule:** If multiple players at the same position are injured, consider compound effects
**Rationale:** Multiple injuries can compound and cause larger impact
**Implementation:** Apply additional multiplier for multiple injuries at same position

---

## üîÑ **WEIGHT REDISTRIBUTION**

### **REMOVED 5% FIXED INJURY WEIGHT:**
The old system used a fixed 5% weight for all injuries, which skewed predictions. This has been completely removed.

### **NEW WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION:**
```
Enhanced EPA:          26% (was 24%)
Enhanced Efficiency:   26% (was 24%)
Enhanced Yards:        21% (was 19%)
Enhanced Turnovers:    21% (was 19%)
PFF Matchups:           8% (unchanged)
Weather:                1% (unchanged)
Dynamic Injuries:    Direct Impact (was 5% fixed)
```

### **Rationale:**
- **EPA/Efficiency increased:** More important for team performance
- **Yards/Turnovers increased:** More important for team performance
- **Dynamic Injuries:** Now directly impact win probability instead of fixed weight

---

## üìà **IMPACT CALCULATION FORMULA**

### **Final Impact Formula:**
```
Final Impact = Base Impact √ó Backup Adjustment √ó Status Multiplier √ó Position Multiplier
```

### **Where:**
- **Base Impact:** Position and PFF grade specific (8-20% for QB, 1-5% for skill, etc.)
- **Backup Adjustment:** Quality of backup player (0.3-1.0)
- **Status Multiplier:** Injury status (0.0-1.0)
- **Position Multiplier:** Position importance within group (0.6-1.0 for OL)

---

## üéØ **REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Elite QB Injured**
```
Player: Josh Allen (QB) - OUT
PFF Grade: 90.0 (Elite)
Backup Grade: 60.0 (Poor)
Base Impact: 20% win probability drop
Backup Adjustment: 0.3 (poor backup)
Status Multiplier: 1.0 (OUT)
Final Impact: 20% √ó 0.3 √ó 1.0 = 6.0% win probability drop
```

### **Example 2: Elite WR Doubtful**
```
Player: Stefon Diggs (WR) - DOUBTFUL
PFF Grade: 85.0 (Elite)
Backup Grade: 70.0 (Average)
Base Impact: 5% win probability drop
Backup Adjustment: 0.6 (average backup)
Status Multiplier: 0.8 (DOUBTFUL)
Final Impact: 5% √ó 0.6 √ó 0.8 = 2.4% win probability drop
```

### **Example 3: Average DE Injured**
```
Player: Von Miller (DE) - OUT
PFF Grade: 80.0 (Above Average)
Backup Grade: 75.0 (Above Average)
Base Impact: 1% win probability drop
Backup Adjustment: 0.3 (good backup)
Status Multiplier: 1.0 (OUT)
Final Impact: 1% √ó 0.3 √ó 1.0 = 0.3% win probability drop
```

### **Example 4: QUESTIONABLE Player**
```
Player: Tua Tagovailoa (QB) - QUESTIONABLE
PFF Grade: 85.0 (Elite)
Backup Grade: 60.0 (Poor)
Base Impact: 20% win probability drop
Backup Adjustment: 0.3 (poor backup)
Status Multiplier: 0.0 (QUESTIONABLE = healthy)
Final Impact: 20% √ó 0.3 √ó 0.0 = 0% win probability drop
```

- Backup quality adjustments
- Injury status rules (OUT/DOUBTFUL vs QUESTIONABLE)
- Weight redistribution (removed 5% fixed weight)
