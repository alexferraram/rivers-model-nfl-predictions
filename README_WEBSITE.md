# NFL Predictions Website

A straightforward web application that displays NFL predictions generated by the RIVERS model, with historical tracking and result updates.

## Features

- **Week-by-Week Predictions**: Generate and view predictions for any NFL week
- **Historical Tracking**: Browse predictions from previous weeks
- **Result Updates**: Update predictions with actual game scores
- **Performance Statistics**: Track model accuracy over time
- **Clean Display Format**: Shows winner, confidence, and injury reports (without percentage impacts)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Website
```bash
python3 run_website.py
```

Or directly:
```bash
python3 app.py
```

### 3. Access the Website
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## Website Structure

### Pages

- **Home** (`/`): Dashboard with options to generate predictions or view historical data
- **Week Predictions** (`/week/<week_number>`): View predictions for a specific week
- **Update Results** (`/update_results/<week_number>`): Update game results with actual scores
- **Statistics** (`/stats`): View model performance metrics

### Database

The website uses SQLite to store:
- **Predictions**: Week, teams, predicted winner, confidence, injury reports
- **Results**: Week, teams, actual scores, actual winner

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Generate Predictions
1. Go to the home page
2. Select a week number
3. Click "Generate Predictions"
4. The RIVERS model will run and save predictions to the database

### 2. View Predictions
- Navigate to any week using the week navigation
- See predictions in the clean format:
  ```
  🏈 MIA @ BUF
  🏆 Winner: BUF
  🎯 Confidence: 80.7%
  🏥 Injury Report: BUF: Matt Milano (LB) - OUT, Ed Oliver (DT) - OUT | MIA: Storm Duck (CB) - OUT, Ifeatu Melifonwu (S) - OUT, Darren Waller (TE) - OUT
  ```

### 3. Update Results
1. After games are played, go to "Update Results" for that week
2. Enter the actual scores for each game
3. The system will automatically determine the actual winner
4. Predictions will show whether they were correct or incorrect

### 4. Track Performance
- Visit the Statistics page to see:
  - Overall accuracy percentage
  - Weekly performance breakdown
  - Total predictions vs correct predictions

## Customization

### Display Format
The prediction display format is defined in `app.py` in the `format_injury_report()` function. You can modify this to change how injury reports are displayed.

### Styling
Customize the appearance by editing `static/css/style.css`.

### Model Integration
The RIVERS model integration is in the `generate_predictions()` route in `app.py`. Currently set to generate Week 3 predictions, but can be modified to handle different weeks.

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Database**: SQLite (file-based database)
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 + Custom CSS
- **Model**: RIVERS NFL prediction model
- **Port**: 5000 (default Flask port)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Use different port
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Database errors**: Delete `nfl_predictions.db` to reset the database

4. **Model errors**: Ensure all RIVERS model files are present and working

### Logs
The Flask app runs in debug mode, so you'll see detailed logs in the terminal where you started the server.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Support for different seasons
- [ ] Export predictions to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Email notifications for new predictions
- [ ] Mobile-responsive improvements
- [ ] Advanced statistics and charts
- [ ] User authentication and multiple users
- [ ] API endpoints for external access

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the terminal logs for error messages
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify the RIVERS model is working correctly
4. Check that the database file has proper permissions
