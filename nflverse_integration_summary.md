## üéØ How Our Model Uses This Data

### Data Collection Process
1. **Automated Access**: Our `data_collector.py` uses the `nflverse` Python package to access the nflverse-data repository
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automated data releases ensure data is always current
3. **Data Processing**: Our preprocessors extract features from play-by-play, team, and player data
4. **Feature Engineering**: Advanced features created from situational stats, injuries, matchups
5. **Fantasy Integration**: Additional data sources (nfldata, dynastyprocess, ffopportunity) enhance the model
6. **Model Training**: 200+ features used for comprehensive NFL game prediction
